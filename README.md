Description
This repository contains a .NET project for creating a web page that allows users to search for flights by providing various information such as one-way or round-trip, departure city, arrival city, departure date, return date, number of passengers, and class type (economy, business, etc.). The project integrates auto-completion for city names to enhance user experience.

The application uses an external API, such as Amadeus Developer API, to retrieve flight information. The search results are displayed to the user, and they can be sorted based on criteria like price, flight duration, etc.
